# basically the idea here is to make sure your FeGenie folder matches this one: `FEET-settup/Folder-Settup/FEET/FeGenie`
#copy the hmm files as outlined in `SuppTbl4_FeGenieSearchAdditions_Edit1.csv` to `FeGenie/hmms/iron/iron_reduction/` 
#Copy their bitscore cuttoffs to `FeGenie/hmms/iron/HMM-bitcutoffs.txt` (simply replaceing file not recommended because of recent additions to FeGenie)
#Also copy the following files to `FeGenie/hmms/iron/iron_reduction/alignments/`
CbcA.fa
CbcB.fa
CbcL.fa
ExtA_pcc_cyt.fa
ExtB_porin.fa
ExtC_pcc_lp_cyt.fa
ExtD_pcc_lp_cyt.fa
ImcH.fa
#and copy the following file to `FeGenie/hmms/iron/iron_reduction/non-aligned/`
